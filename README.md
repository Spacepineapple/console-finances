## Description <a id="description"></a>

This page was created as my solution to the fourth challenge task of a web
development bootcamp. For this task, I was provided with some starter code
consisting of an index.html file containing all of the basic HTML boilerplate
and a JavaScript file containing a single variable -- an array called finances.
This array contained a number of smaller arrays, each consisting of a single
month and a single numerical value.

My task for this activity was to calculate:
1. The total number of months in the array
2. The net total of the values in the array
3. The average monthly change of the numerical values in the array
4. The period with the greatest monthly increase
5. The value of this greatest monthly increase
6. The period with the greatest monthly decrease
7. The value of this greatest monthly decrease.

Finally, I was asked to log each of these values to the console in a specific
format which matches the format that can be seen in the screenshot of the
appearance of the page below.

The appearance of the page is as follows:
